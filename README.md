# axi-1milliondrawings
Python script for working with the [AxiDraw](https://www.axidraw.com/) v3 pen plotter (and any cheap alibaba copy ;)\
driven by the unoffical library "axi" [by fogleman](https://github.com/fogleman/axi)\
[the script](plotter.py) will plot any drawing created via [1milliondrawings.com](https://1milliondrawings.com/)

## basics
- once you installed the library and connected your plotter you could perform cool stuff via the console
- go to [1milliondrawings.com](https://1milliondrawings.com/), create a login, draw your own or just play around with one of the existing drawings
- if you don't want to plot your own drawings you don't even need a login...
